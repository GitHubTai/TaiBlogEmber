	body: 'One lesson that Van Gaal will impart this summer while others prattle irrelevantly is how to recruit a top striker to, ahem, make up for United’s bungling in that department last summer. And the word is that top striker will be Mario Mandzukic, who successfully replaced Diego Costa at Atlético Madrid last season – for a while, before losing his touch and falling out of favour with Diego Simeone. On the other hand, United may forego the services of Mandzukic and instead join Arsenal, Liverpool and Milan in trying to persuade Zlatan Ibrahimovic that they are worthy of him.'
